Overview

The "Library Inventory Management System" is designed to manage a library's inventory, track its members, and handle borrow/return transactions efficiently. This project provides a streamlined way to keep track of the books available in the library, the members registered, and all the book transactions happening in the library.

Description

This system allows library administrators to:
Manage Books: Keep track of book details, including the title, author, genre, and quantity available.
Manage Members: Store member information such as name, email, phone number, and membership date.
Track Transactions: Record every transaction involving borrowing or returning of books by the library members.

Features

Book Management: Add, update, delete, and retrieve book details.
Member Management: Register new members, update member information, and view member lists.
Transaction Tracking: Log transactions for borrowing and returning books, and easily retrieve transaction histories.
Data Consistency: Uses foreign key constraints to maintain data consistency across tables.
Error Handling: Ensures that no invalid transactions can occur through data validation.

Usage

To Add Books: Use the `INSERT` query to add new books to the inventory.
To Add Members: Use the `INSERT` query to register new members.
To Borrow or Return Books: Use the `Transactions` table to log borrow and return operations.
Data Retrieval: Use `SELECT` queries to view lists of books, members, and transaction details.
